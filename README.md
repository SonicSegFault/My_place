# My Portfolio Site

Welcome to my portfolio site! This is where I showcase my various projects, including web development, programming, and game development.

## Projects

### Snake Game

One of the featured projects on this site is a classic Snake game, which I have developed using C++ and the Raylib library. The game has been converted to WebAssembly using Emscripten, allowing it to run directly in the browser.

#### How to Play

Navigate to the Snake game page on this site to start playing. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake and try to eat as many apples as you can without running into the walls or yourself.

#### Dependencies (optional)

- **Raylib**: An open-source library for game development.
  - [Raylib Official Website](https://www.raylib.com/)
  - [Raylib Functions Cheat Sheet](https://www.raylib.com/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.html)

- **Emscripten**: A toolchain for compiling C++ to WebAssembly, making it possible to run C++ code in web browsers.

#### Technology Stack

- **HTML/CSS/JS**: The foundation of the website.
- **Raylib**: Used for game development.
- **C++**: The programming language used to develop the Snake game.
- **Emscripten**: Converts the C++ code to WebAssembly for browser compatibility.
